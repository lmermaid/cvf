**Adj. au chef de bureau "Industrie & Innovation"** @ [Direction G√©n√©rale du Tr√©sor](https://www.tresor.economie.gouv.fr/) _(Sept 2021 - Pr√©sent)_<br>

Les administrations cherchent √† se moderniser et ont de nouveaux
besoins en mati√®re de compr√©hension des probl√®mes financiers
rencontr√©s par les universit√©s. Je construis un cadre d‚Äôanalyse pour
documenter l‚Äôefficience des universit√©s et ainsi optimiser leurs
fonctionnements. Ce projet s‚Äôappuie sur l‚Äôappariemment de plusieurs
bases administratives et permet de fournir de nouvelles
visualisations des m√©triques par m√©thode de "clustering" mettant ainsi
en √©vidence de nouveaux faits stylis√©s.

## Documents de travail 

- **Menez (2020) Exploiting Spatial Filtering Methods for Tracing Space-Time Developments : Experiments on Regional Income Disparities in the EU-28**

The aim of this article is to update the study of the dynamics of European regional wealth inequalities over time and space. This purpose is achieved by using the Exact Approach to obtain Moran‚Äôs spatial autocorrelation index‚Äôs true distributions. Our work looks at the Enlarged Europe from 2000 to 2016 using an alternative exact method to the permutation technique used in LeGallo and Ertur (2003)‚Äôs seminal paper. We highlight the polarization that took place over the European territory at the beginning of the period (2000-2004). We then observe a slowdown in the concentration processes starting from 2009. In a second step, we further exploit the Exact Approach in confronting different forms of spatial interdependencies that could influence spatial disparities‚Äô patterns.

- **Menez (2020) Spatial autocorrelation augmented Common Correlated Effects estimators : What is the fair share of private returns to R&D ?**

This article proposes a refined econometric estimation of a spatially extended growth accounting framework by addressing the issue of error cross sectional dependence under both its strong and weak forms. Enhancements of the growth accounting framework point to the existence of an omitted variable issue induced by variables‚Äô mis- measurements and spatial spillovers. Such omitted elements simultaneously induce strong and weak forms of cross-sectional dependence and indeed, a preliminary analysis based on the estimation of the exponent of cross- sectional dependence provides a clear result in favor of the occurence of strong cross-sectional dependence. Yet, a sharp understanding of the spatial dimension of R&D efforts requires methods that can separate out the relation- ship between spatial units that is due to the effect of common factors from the one that is due to effective spatial proximity. From this distinction depends a proper assessment of the question of over/under investment in R&D and its policy implications. Toward this objective, we propose two estimation strategies : a two-step estimation, based on Bailey and al.(2016) proposition, that overlay common correlated effects methods and spatial SAR models and a one-step estimation using the spatially, common correlated effects augmented GMM estimator recently developed by Yang (2018). We find evidences in favor of the over-investment hypothesis in European R&D activities.

- **Menez (2020) The role of commercial and technological integrations in shaping regional agglomeration and welfare**

This article investigates the economic literature which focuses on the role of trade costs as a crucial determinant of agglomeration processes and regional welfare outcomes. New Economic Geography models put trade costs at the core of agglomeration mechanisms such that as trade costs decrease, trade flows across regions densify to compensate for the agglomeration of activities. However, the empirical counterpart that uses gravity framework has confronted the ‚Äôparadox of distance‚Äô in failing to document a decreasing relationship between trade flows and trade costs despite ever wider globalization. Among the many explanations to this paradox, we concur with those supposing the existence of various forms of trade costs potentially playing in opposite directions upon agglomera- tion outcomes. This hypothesis happens to be well founded in the distinction made by New Economic Geography and Growth models between commercial and technological forms of integrations. Commercial integration, involving the exchange of goods and services, is expected to play in favor agglomeration processes while technological inte- gration, involving the transfer of ideas, should temper the concentration of economic activity in a unique location. Few empirical studies consider this hypothesis and those papers linking agglomeration processes to Marshallian externalities maintained strong assumptions of linearity while missing to properly relate to economic theory. Recent advances have provided exploitable reduced forms but as they maintain a simplified ‚Äôtwo-regions‚Äô configuration, they cannot account for the complex network interactions occurring in a multi-regional context. Quantitative Trade Models recently overcame this methodological shortcoming but they don‚Äôt provide yet insights regarding the inter- play of various forms of trade costs. Empirically, a few recent papers using natural experiments address network issues in multi-regional framework. As such, they constitute a promising avenue for further research.

- **Menez (2020) The determinants of spatial agglomeration**
This article addresses the sharp criticisms raised by Combes and Gobillon (2014) to the framework conditioning industries‚Äô agglomeration outcomes to Marshallian externalities. Against those that worked in the wake of Rosenthal and Strange (2001), Combes and Gobillon (2014) considers that no robust theoretical foundations robustly ground the empirical specification, that most studies make simplifying linear assumptions while estimating the relationship and endogeneity has been weakly addressed. We take interest on agglomeration at the regional level rather than co-agglomeration between industries and make propositions regarding those three issues raised by Combes and Gobillon (2014). First, we ground our specification on a generalized New Economic Geography and Growth model to properly re-define the forces at stake in explaining agglomeration patterns. The model developed by Montmartin (2015) conditions the agglomeration patterns at the regional scale to transport costs on goods and transfer costs on ideas. Transport costs on goods and transfer costs on ideas are expected to be forces that constrain the spread of pecuniary and non-pecuniary externalities that themselves relate to what some others call input-output linkages and knowledge spillovers respectively. While we expect pecuniary externalities to trigger agglomeration, the spread of non-pecuniary externalities should temper the dynamic. We propose innovative measures in an attempt to proxy for those phenomena. Second, we conduct non-linear estimations using Generalized Additive models. Our results illustrate the role of low transport costs in triggering agglomeration and the role of low transfer costs on ideas in tempering this.
